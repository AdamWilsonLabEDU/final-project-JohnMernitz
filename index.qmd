# Introduction

Trees are often overlooked as a component of urban spaces. With so much focus on the growth of infrastructure, living space, and work spaces, green places are left little room to grow. Tree leaf area coverage, while possibly annoying for lawn owners in the fall, is directly related to shade capacity and other environmental benefits of trees. Permeable surfaces where trees grow also reduce runoff, trees cool the surrounding air in sufficient density, and the mental and aesthetic benefits of green spaces in urban areas for residents and tourists are notable. Urban forestry bureaus seek to classify and present some of these benefits to the public.

Quantifying and estimating the possible value of these services in relation to tree occurrence seemed like an interesting topic to delve into. Vacant spots and stumps of former trees cannot provide benefits any longer. While an intensive endeavor to replace fully grown trees, my project seeks to enumerate how useful it could be to increase tree cover. Parsing data to assign relative values for comparable trees will assist in more accurate estimation of services. Individual versus collective benefit will also be questioned, but only after calculation of total possible benefits are complete.

# Materials and methods

\[\~ 200 words\]

Narrative: Clear narrative description of the data sources and methods. Includes data from at least two sources that were integrated / merged in R.

Publicly available data from the City of Buffalo Bureau of Forestry includes multiple categories to represent trees' ecosystem services. Downloading and processing this data is necessary, as there are 133,230 entries in the dataset.

Code: The code associated with the project is well organized and easy to follow. Demonstrates mastery of R graphics and functions.

Data: The underlying data are publicly accessible via the web and downloaded/accessed within the Rmd script. If you want to use your own data, you must make it available on a website (e.g. Figshare) so that others are able to re-run your code.

You can do bullets like this:

-   The first most important thing
-   https://data.buffalony.gov/api/views/n4ni-uuec/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD
-   The second most important thing
-   The third most important thing

You can do numbers like this:

1.  The first most important thing
2.  The second most important thing
3.  The third most important thing

See <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/> for all the amazing things you can do.

Here's my first code chunk.

```{r}
x=3+4
```

Refer to output in your narrative like this: x=`r x` .

Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
library(kableExtra)
library(htmlwidgets)
library(widgetframe)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(widgetframe_widgets_dir = 'widgets' ) 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)  # cache the results for quick compiling
```

## Download and clean all required data

```{r}
n=20
data=data.frame(x=runif(n,-180,180),
                y=runif(n,-60,60),
                size = runif(n, 5, 20),
                category = factor(
                  sample(letters[1:5], n, replace = TRUE)
                  ),
                value = rnorm(n))
```

```{r, results='asis'}
data %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% #show only 1:n rows
  kable(digits=2,align="c")%>% #make table and round to two digits
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 
                  c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) #apply other formatting
```

Add any additional processing steps here.

# Results

\[\~200 words\]

Tables and figures (maps and other graphics) are carefully planned to convey the results of your analysis. Intense exploration and evidence of many trials and failures. The author looked at the data in many different ways before coming to the final presentation of the data.

Show tables, plots, etc. and describe them.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Map of completely random data"}
m <- leaflet(data) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(~x, ~y, radius = ~size,color = ~as.factor(category)) %>% 
  addPopups(~x[2], ~y[2], "Random popup")
m  # a map with the default OSM tile layer
```

```{r}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=y,col=category))+
  geom_point()
```

### Dygraphs Example

```{r}
library(dygraphs)
dygraph(nhtemp, main = "New Haven Temperatures") |> 
  dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c("1920-01-01", "1960-01-01")) 
```

# Conclusions

\[\~200 words\]

Clear summary adequately describing the results and putting them in context. Discussion of further questions and ways to continue investigation.
